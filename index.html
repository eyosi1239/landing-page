								<h2>Get to Know me</h2>
								<p>I am Eyosias Tesfaye, a student at Minnesota State University, Mankato, pursuing a double major in computer science and Statistics. During my stay in MNSU I plan to develop skills that will allow me to excel in the fields of Data Science and AI Engineering. Alongside developing my technical skills, I am committed to developing a strong foundation as a learner and building meaningful connections.Inspired by  Einstein's words, "The only source of knowledge is experience," I strive to gain practical experience and apply my knowledge in real-world scenarios. </p>

							<ul class="features">
								<li class="icon fa-paper-plane">
									<h3>Academic Experience</h3>
									<p>My studies in computer science and statistics have provided a strong foundation in programming languages such as Java, Python, and SQL. Key coursework, including Data Structures & Object-Oriented Programming, Discrete Mathematics, Computing and Applications, and Calculus 1-2, has sharpened my skills in algorithm development, computational theory, and data analysis</p>
								</li>
								<li class="icon solid fa-laptop">
									<h3>Little Spider Solitaire Project</h3>
									<p>This project provided me with an opportunity to deepen my knowledge of object-oriented programming in Python. Through developing this game, I enhance my skills in designing and implementing game logic, managing complex data structures, and creating interactive user interfaces. The project also strengthened my overall computer science abilities by applying principles of game design and algorithm development to build a functional and engaging application.</p>
								</li>
								<li class="icon fa-flag">
									<h3>Purple USA project</h3>
									<p>This project is an interactive election map visualization tool. It  involved designing a user-friendly interface for visualizing election data and dynamically generating color-coded maps based on user input. Through this project, I enhance my abilities in data visualization, user interface design, and input validation, while also deepening my understanding of dynamic data handling and application development.</p>
								</li>
								<li class="icon fa-certificate">
									<span class="label">Your Label Here</span>
									<h3>Headstarter Fellowship</h3>
									<p>This is an upcoming endeavor in which I hope to further develop my skills and establish myself as a capable and innovative professional in my field. The Headstarter Fellowship offers a unique opportunity to engage in advanced projects, collaborate with industry leaders, and gain deeper insights into cutting-edge technologies. I am excited to leverage this experience to refine my expertise, contribute meaningfully to the field, and pave the way for a successful career in computer science.</p>
